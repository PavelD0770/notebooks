    "# Visualizing GPU Resource Utilization with PyNVML and Bokeh\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base Envirnonment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to visualize GPU utilization for this demo, we start by createing a base conda environment with [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) packages:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name bokeh-pynvml \\\n",
    "    -c defaults -c nvidia -c rapidsai \\\n",
    "    -c pytorch -c numba -c conda-forge \\\n",
    "    cudf=0.7 cuml=0.7 python=3.7 cudatoolkit=9.2 \\\n",
    "    nodejs jupyterlab dask dask-cudf dask-cuda bokeh -y\n",
    "conda activate bokeh-pynvml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I am personally using a DGX machine with eight V100 NVIDIA GPUs for the development of this demo (`Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-135-generic x86_64`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before or after activating our base conda environment, we should also choose a specific root-directory location for this demo:\n",
    "```\n",
    "export demo_home='/home/nfs/rzamora/workspace/pynvml-bokeh-demo'\n",
    "mkdir $demo_home; cd $demo_home\n",

    "### Python Bindings for the NVIDIA Management Library (PyNVML)\n",
    "\n",
    "PyNVML is a python wrapper for the [NVIDIA Management Library (NVML)](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-management-library-nvml), which is a C-based API for monitoring and managing various states of NVIDIA GPU devices. NVML is directly used by the better-known [NVIDIA System Management Interface](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface) (`nvidia-smi`). According to the NVIDA developer site, NVML provides access to the following query-able states (in additional to modifiable states not discussed here):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ECC error counts**: Both correctable single bit and detectable double bit errors are reported. Error counts are provided for both the current boot cycle and for the lifetime of the GPU.\n",
    "- **GPU utilization**: Current utilization rates are reported for both the compute resources of the GPU and the memory interface.\n",
    "- **Active compute process**: The list of active processes running on the GPU is reported, along with the corresponding process name/id and allocated GPU memory.\n",
    "- **Clocks and PState**: Max and current clock rates are reported for several important clock domains, as well as the current GPU performance state.\n",
    "- **Temperature and fan speed**: The current core GPU temperature is reported, along with fan speeds for non-passive products.\n",
    "- **Power management**: For supported products, the current board power draw and power limits are reported.\n",
    "- **Identification**: Various dynamic and static information is reported, including board serial numbers, PCI device ids, VBIOS/Inforom version numbers and product names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although several different python wrappers for NVML currently exist, I will be using the [PyNVML](https://github.com/gpuopenanalytics/pynvml) package hosted by GoAi on GitHub. This version of PyNVML uses `ctypes` to wrap most of the NVML C API.  For this demo, we will focus on a small subset of the API needed to query real-time GPU-resource utilization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `nvmlInit()`: Initialize an NVML profiling session\n",
    "- `nvmlShutdown()`: Finalize an NVML profiling session\n",
    "- `nvmlDeviceGetCount()`: Get the number of available NVIDA GPU devices\n",
    "- `nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex()`: Get a handle for a device (given an integer index)\n",
    "- `nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo()`: Get a memory-info object (given a device handle)\n",
    "- `nvmlDeviceGetUtilizationRates()`: Get a utlization-rate object (given a device handle)\n",
    "- `nvmlDeviceGetPcieThroughput()`: Get a PCIe-trhoughput object (given a device handle)\n",
